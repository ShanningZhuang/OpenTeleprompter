# Bug Fixes and New Features

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Play Button Not Working (Initial Fix)
**Problem:** The play button wasn't working because the scroll ref was pointing to the wrong element.

**Solution:**
- Changed `scrollRef` to point to the actual scrollable div (the one with `overflow-y-scroll`) instead of the outer container with `overflow-hidden`
- Updated the scroll position logic to work with the correct element

**Files Changed:**
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:660) - Updated ref assignment to the scrollable div

### 2. Play Button Not Working in Fullscreen Mode
**Problem:** The play button worked in preview mode but not in fullscreen mode because the fullscreen scrollable div didn't have a ref.

**Solution:**
- Added separate `fullscreenScrollRef` to track the fullscreen scrollable div
- Updated scrolling logic to use the appropriate ref based on `isFullscreen` state
- Both preview and fullscreen scroll positions stay synchronized

**Files Changed:**
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:181) - Added fullscreenScrollRef
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:185-217) - Updated scroll logic to handle both modes
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:760) - Added ref to fullscreen scrollable div

### 3. Scroll Position Jumping After Manual Scroll
**Problem:** When you manually scrolled the content and then pressed play, it would jump back to the previous position instead of continuing from where you scrolled to.

**Solution:**
- Added scroll event listeners to both preview and fullscreen divs
- Syncs manual scroll position to state when not playing
- State updates only when user manually scrolls (not during auto-scrolling)

**Files Changed:**
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:222-243) - Added manual scroll sync logic

### 4. First Line Not Starting at Indicator Position
**Problem:** The script started at the top of the screen, requiring scrolling before the first line reached the reading indicator (eye level).

**Solution:**
- Dynamically calculates top padding based on indicator position
- Adds extra padding equal to indicator position percentage of viewport height
- First line now appears at the indicator line when script starts
- Updates automatically when indicator position or margins change

**Files Changed:**
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:181-182) - Added padding state variables
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:245-252) - Calculate indicator-aligned padding
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:717) - Applied padding to preview
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:1034) - Applied padding to fullscreen

### 5. Mirror Transform Issues
**Problem:** The transform syntax was incorrect, causing mirror modes not to work properly.

**Solution:**
- Fixed transform syntax from `scale${conditional}(-1)` to proper `scaleX(-1)` and `scaleY(-1)` syntax
- Applied transforms separately with proper spacing

**Files Changed:**
- [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx:551) - Fixed mirror transform syntax
